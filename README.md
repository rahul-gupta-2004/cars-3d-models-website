## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- A web browser
- A text editor (optional, for any changes)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/3d-model-gallery.git](https://github.com/rahul-gupta-2004/cars-3d-models-website.git)
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd 3d-model-gallery
3. Serve the project using a live server or a local web server like Apache. Running the project directly from the local file system (e.g., opening index.html directly in the browser) may cause issues due to browser security restrictions.

Using Live Server
If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can use the Live Server extension. Install the extension, then right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server".

Using Apache
If you have Apache installed, move the project directory to your Apache htdocs directory and access it via http://localhost/3d-model-gallery.
